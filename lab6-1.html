<p>A man who lost his Apple Watch while body surfing in Huntington Beach, California had a nice surprise this week. Robert Bainter originally lost his Apple Watch six months ago, but this month it made its way back to him – in working condition.</p>
<p>As detailed by local news outlet KTLA, Bainter lost his Apple Watch while surfing in Huntington Beach late last year. He describes the Apple Watch as his “good luck charm” when surfing as it can show him detailed information about his location. After a big wave, however, the Apple Watch fell of his arm:</p>
<p>“This thing has been my good luck charm. I would use it quite often to show the surf and how fast you were going. It would even show you where you were on the beach,” said Bainter.</p>

<p>Until “a huge wave came and you know I was loving it, rode it and then I pick up my arm and like ‘Oh My God,’ what just happened.”</p>
